## Project Name
Build a House
## About
This project recreates the "Build-a-House" challenge from Khan Academy's Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation course. It uses JavaScript with Processing.js-style drawing commands to create a simple house illustration, emphasizing the use of loops for repetitive elements like windows and grass.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required (runs in a standard web browser; assumes Processing.js environment or equivalent for drawing functions).
## Features
This Build a House includes these features:

-House structure with walls, triangular roof, and wooden door

-Central circular window and rectangular windows drawn in rows using for loops

-Repeating grass blocks loaded from images via a loop

-Sky blue background and colored fills for visual appeal

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Build_House.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (index.html or build_house.js) from the command line or browser:

-Open index.html in a web browser to view the house drawing.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master for loops to efficiently draw repeating elements like windows and grass

-Practice coordinate-based drawing and shape functions (rect, ellipse, triangle) in JavaScript

-Understand how to structure drawing code in a draw() function for Processing.js-style environments
